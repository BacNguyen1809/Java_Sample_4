# Java_Sample_4
Objectives:
Understand basic concepts and can use Operator in Java.
Lab Specifications:
Create an ArithmeticDemo class with method main() to test arithmetic operators.

Create an UnaryDemo class with method main() to illustrates the prefix/postfix unary increment operators.

Create an InstanceofDemo class with the method main(). Defines a parent class (named Parent), a simple interface (named MyInterface), and a child class (named Child) that inherits from the parent and implements the interface.

Problem Descriptions:
Requirement: write a java console program.

Change type of result to double in ArimethicDemo.java. After that run file and view the result on the console. How to cast the result to Int?

What happens if try perform operator "+" with boolean type in ArimethicDemo.java

Guess the output if perform action expression below:

i += i++ + (++i) + (++i) + i++

         in UnaryDemo.java

Can you explain the result when run file InstanceofDemo.java base on knowledge of OOP concept
Guidelines:
Step1: Open Eclipse IDE

Step2: Create a new project named Exercise0501

Step3: Create a package named exercise

Step4: Create three classes in turn named ArithmeticDemo, UnaryDemo, InstanceofDemo in this project as follows:

ArithmeticDemo 

UnaryDemo 
InstanceofDemo.java
MyInterface.java
Parent.java
Child.java
